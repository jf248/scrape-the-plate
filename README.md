# scrape-the-plate
A work in progress...

Building a web app for scraping and saving recipes.

Using a React/Redux/Saga frontend and Django-REST-Framework backend.

Currently working on building re-usable form components like comboboxes/
dropdowns/autofill using the `material-ui` and `dropdown` libraries.

Demo of my 'Combobox' is here:
