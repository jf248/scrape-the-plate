    "preparation": "To make the scrambled eggs, whisk the eggs and cayenne in a small bowl; season generously with salt (about 1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/8 teaspoon fine salt is good).\n\nHeat the 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. As soon as it begins to foam, add the eggs and cook, whisking constantly, until they have set in small curds and are beginning to look dry, about 1 minute. Immediately remove from heat and whisk in cream cheese. Note: Eggs can be scrambled 2 hours ahead, then spread into a single layer in a sheet pan. Store tightly covered at room temperature, then trim into squares to fit each sandwich. Don't worry about the initial shape being perfect, as you can press any lingering scraps of egg into the sandwiches as well\u2014no waste!\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to make the sandwiches, divide the cheese between the slices of bread and top with egg mixture. Close up sandwiches.\n\nHeat a dry large skillet over medium-low and brush very lightly with butter. Toast sandwiches until the bread is golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 3 minutes per side. Serve immediately.\n\nNote: At Du's, Dufresne also serves a bacon version. To make your own: cut 2 slices of bacon per sandwich into lardons, pan-fry to render out the bacon fat, then drain the crisped bacon on paper towels, reserving the fat. Scramble the eggs in a mix of half butter, half bacon fat. Fold the crisped, drained bacon into the eggs with the cream cheese.",

Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds.

    "preparation": "Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil and about a teaspoon of black pepper in a medium skillet over medium-low heat until ingredients are fragrant and pepper is barely starting to sizzle, about 1 minute. Set aside.\n\nPlace spaghetti in a large skillet and cover with water. Season with a small pinch of salt, then bring to a boil over high heat, prodding spaghetti occasionally with a fork or wooden spoon to prevent it from clumping. Cook until spaghetti is al dente (typically about 1 minute less than the package recommends). Transfer 2 to 3 tablespoons of pasta cooking water to the skillet with the olive oil/pepper mixture. Stir in butter. Using tongs, lift spaghetti and transfer it to the oil/butter mixture.\n\nAdd cheese and remaining tablespoon olive oil to the skillet and stir with a fork until cheese is completely melted. Add a few more tablespoons of pasta water to the skillet to adjust consistency, reheating as necessary until the sauce is creamy and coats each strand of spaghetti. Season to taste with salt and more black pepper. Serve immediately, passing extra grated cheese and black pepper at the table.",
    "notes": "The ultimate Roman midnight snack. [Photographs: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] Serious Eats VIDEOS Watch More Videos Replay If you were to watch a practiced hand make cacio e pepe, you might think the instructions were as simple as this: Cook spaghetti and drain. Toss with olive oil, butter, black pepper, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Serve. But we all know that the simplest recipes can often be the most confounding, and so it is with cacio e pepe. Follow those instructions and, if you're lucky, you'll get what you're after: a creamy, emulsified sauce that coats each strand of spaghetti with flavor. More likely, you're gonna get what I (and, from the stories I've heard, many others as well) got on the first few tries\u2014spaghetti in a thin, greasy sauce, or spaghetti with clumps of cheese that refuse to melt. Or, worse, both at the same time. Here's how to make it perfectly every time.",

    "title": "Curried Lentils With Coconut Milk",
    "slug": "curried-lentils-with-coconut-milk",
    "preparation": "In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the ginger, garlic, shallot (or onion), coriander, cumin, and turmeric and cook, stirring now and then, until the vegetables are softened and the spices are very fragrant, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the lentils, coconut milk, and 1 to 2 teaspoons kosher salt (Note: if you are sensitive to salt or using table salt or even Morton's kosher salt, which is saltier than Diamond Crystal kosher salt, start with 1 teaspoon, then add more to taste\u2014I use Diamond Crystal and so typically use 2, but use your judgement), then fill the empty coconut-milk can with water and add it to the saucepan. It will look like a lot of liquid, but the lentils will absorb it as they cook. Stir everything together, turn the heat to high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn the heat to low and let the lentils simmer, stirring now and then, until they\u2019re completely soft, about 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt. (Note: If you're using those French green lentils, you will need to cook this longer, 30 to 45 minutes. Just keep tasting to see when the lentils are cooked through. You may or may not need to add more water.)\n\nServe the lentils hot over rice. Top each serving with a spoonful of yogurt and a sprinkle of cilantro. A side of naan is nice, too.",
    "notes": "Author Notes: From Julia Turshen's Small Victories, these lentils come together in about 30 minutes, are deeply satisfying, and could be vegan if you leave out the yogurt. Naan is also really nice on the side here. Re lentils: I like to use a mix of French green lentils and red split lentils. It's faster if you use solely the red split lentils, but I love the texture offered by the French green ones when they're part of the mix. It's completely delicious both ways, so use what you have. Do plan a little bit more ahead if you use the French green lentils \u2014 they may take as long as 45 minutes to cook if not longer.",
